It uses new Akka TCP stack (introduced in akka 2.2). It aims to be full Stomp 1.2 complete implementation.\r\n\r\nDestinations currently supported:\r\n- non-durable non-persisted topics\r\n- queues (with non-persisted message if subscribers already connected, but unconsumed messages are stored in persisted filesystem journal for future consumption)\r\n\r\nPlease note: project is not yet compatible with STOMP 1.2 and we do not recommend using it in production.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n##### Known unimplemented yet Stomp 1.2 specification features\r\n- Heart-beating\r\n- only acknowledge mode auto is supported\r\n\r\n[STOMP specification static website](http://stomp.github.com/)\r\n\r\n##### Implementation limitations\r\n- due to lack of any persistence layer current transactions are implemented as in memory transactions thus using very large transactions may lead to JVM heap memory problems\r\n- whole project is using default type of akka mailboxes (unbounded) which may lead to JVM heap memory problems in some unfriendly conditions\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- Java 7 (tested on OpenJDK 7 and Oracle JDK 7).\r\n- Maven 3\r\n","google":"UA-47492565-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
